# Gorilla Game Lab

Resources for building a modular puzzle game designed for use by gorillas.

These were developed as part of the [Gorilla Game Lab](https://gorillagamelab.com) project. 



## Design Notes:

- Boxes are lasercut from 6mm plywood
- The frame that holds the puzzles is cut from 12mm plywood (as far as I remember!)
- The whole thing fits together through friction fit, so some playing around with lasercutting tolerances is almost a certainty. The aim was to create the whole thing out of obnly wood and acrylic (or polycarbonate) so that there are no screw, bolts, or metal fastenings that could harm the gorillas if the box was damaged.

If you are building a modular puzzle using these plans, please let me know and I'll try to give some pointers :-)
